# Neurips 2020 SAS Workshop

### Start local development server
You can start the server at localhost:3000, which synchronously changes
the rendered wegpage once you save the code modification.
```
npm run start
```

### Build static files
After development, you can build static files which can be directly put
in github page without react-dependency. The built files will be placed
at `build` directory.
```
npm run build
```
